<description brief="osgWorks">

This package contains a recent version of the osgWorks library (http://code.google.com/p/osgbullet/). 
This ROS package does not intend to modify osgWorks
in any way, it simply provides a convenient way to download and
compile the library, because osgWorks is not available from an OS package
manager. However, this package might contain some temporary patches to
osgWorks while they are being applied upstream, or while a permanent fix
for a problem is being discussed by the osgWorks community.
