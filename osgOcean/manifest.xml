<description brief="osgOcean">

This package contains a recent version of the osgOcean library (http://code.google.com/p/osgocean/). 
This ROS package does not intend to modify osgOcean
in any way, it simply provides a convenient way to download and
compile the library, because osgOcean is not available from an OS package
manager. However, this package might contain some temporary patches to
osgOcean while they are being applied upstream, or while a permanent fix
for a problem is being discussed by the osgOcean community.
